# 💻 Nermine | Backend JavaScript Developer

Hi there! I'm **Nermine**, a backend-focused developer based in Algeria and currently studying Computer Science at **USTHB**. I specialize in **Node.js** and backend development using JavaScript, with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems.  

I also have a solid grounding in front-end technologies and design — I enjoy crafting beautiful UIs (though not into UX flows — I like the pixels, not the psychology!). I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and working on projects that push my limits.

## 🚀 What I'm Focused On

🎯 **Backend Development with JavaScript**  
I’m currently going deep into Node.js — from core modules to async patterns, middleware, APIs, authentication, and more. I'm building real-world applications to master event-driven architectures and scalable systems.

🎯 **Real Projects**  
I prefer working on **practical, real-life projects** over toy examples. I love challenges like:
- Collaborative tools
- Real-time apps
- RESTful and secure backend APIs

🎯 **Freelancing Prep**  
My long-term goal is to become a **freelance backend developer** and work on global projects where I can apply all my backend skills with creativity and autonomy.

## 💬 A Personal Note

I’m passionate, persistent, and practical. I don’t just code to learn — I build to **solve**, **express**, and **grow**. Whether it’s tweaking a UI or debugging an API, I’m all in. Always learning, always building.
