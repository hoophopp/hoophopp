# Nermine | Backend Developer & Ethical Hacking Learner

Hi! I'm **Nermine**, a backend developer and Computer Science student at **USTHB** (Algeria). My core stack is **JavaScript (Node.js)**, and I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **Linux systems** and **ethical hacking** to better understand the environments I build for.

I love building reliable, secure systems and learning the internals of how things work — from API calls to system calls.

## 📚 Currently Learning

> My current focus is mastering Linux and security fundamentals to support backend excellence.

### → **Linux Essentials**
- Filesystems, permissions, shell navigation
- Scripting, process management, environment config

### → **Security & Ethical Hacking**
- Exploring CTFs and Wargames (e.g. OverTheWire’s *Bandit*)
- Studying common exploits and hardening practices
- Learning about authentication, hashing, and access control

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

I learn by doing  not just following tutorials. Whether I’m writing a backend service or exploring privilege escalation in a lab, I seek to **understand deeply** and **document clearly**. My journey blends **software engineering**, **systems**, and **security** into a strong, practical skill set.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Become Linux-proficient and security-conscious as a developer
- Build and contribute to secure, scalable Node.js systems
- Tackle CTF challenges and share learning in a clean, spoiler-free way
- Freelance with confidence and technical depth

---

## 💡 Projects in Progress

- Secure CMS with Node.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL  
- Command-line tools using bash and Node  
- CTF writeups (private/spoiler-free) and system exploration logs  
- Auth systems built from scratch with token/role logic

## ✨ Final Note

I'm here to build  not just code. Whether it's designing a clean API or exploring a Linux file permission bug, I enjoy the *how* just as much as the *what*. This journey is about depth, growth, and becoming the kind of developer who can build and break things responsibly.
